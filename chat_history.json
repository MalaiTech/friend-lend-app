You want me to help you plan the development of a React Native + Expo app called \"FriendLend\" that helps users track personal loans. It should be a local-only iOS app with offline capabilities, data stored locally, and the ability to send loan summaries via the native iOS share sheet. You've provided detailed specifications for the app's core features, design, and technical aspects.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Dashboard:** A home screen displaying key totals (Total Lent, Total Repaid, Outstanding Balance, Interest Earned) and a list of loans with borrower, balance, and status. A floating \"+\" button will allow adding new loans.\n*   **Add Loan:** A form to input borrower name, loan amount, interest rate, start date, due date, and notes. This data will be saved locally.\n*   **Loan Detail:** A screen displaying detailed information about a specific loan, including repayment history and buttons to add payments, mark as paid, and send reminders via the share sheet.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#1E1E1E` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#4285F4` (Blue for main actions and highlights)\n    *   Secondary: `#34A853` (Green for positive actions like repayment)\n    *   Accent: `#FFC107` (Yellow for warnings or important information)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Light blue for highlighting)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like San Francisco (SF Pro Text or SF Pro Display) for iOS, Roboto for Android, or a similar system font.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:** Implement the Dashboard, Add Loan, and Loan Detail screens in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Implement basic UI:** Add the basic UI elements for each screen, including text inputs, buttons, and lists.\n3.  **Implement navigation:** Connect the screens using `expo-router` so the user can navigate between them.\n4.  **Implement local storage:** Since Supabase is not enabled, implement local storage using AsyncStorage to store loan data.\n5.  **Implement the share sheet:** Use the `react-native-share` library to implement the share sheet functionality for sending loan summaries.\n6.  **Implement the floating action button:** Implement the floating \"+\" button on the Dashboard screen.\n7.  **Implement the tab bar:** The tab bar is already implemented, but make sure it is working correctly.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-09T15:10:29.558069"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the FriendLend app!

This can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as:\n\n1.  **Incompatible Library Versions:** Some libraries might not be fully compatible with your current Expo SDK version (54).\n2.  **Missing Native Dependencies:** A required native module might not be correctly linked or installed.\n3.  **Incorrect Setup:** The setup or configuration of a specific library might be incomplete or incorrect.\n4.  **Conflicting Dependencies:** Different libraries might be conflicting with each other.\n\nHere's a breakdown of steps to diagnose and potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1.  **Review Recently Added/Updated Dependencies:**\n    *   Since the app was previously working, focus on libraries you've recently added or updated. Check their documentation for any specific setup instructions or known compatibility issues with Expo SDK 54.\n2.  **Check `metro.config.js` or `metro.config.ts`:**\n    *   Sometimes, specific configurations are needed for certain native modules. Ensure your Metro bundler configuration is correctly set up.\n3.  **Clear Expo's Cache:**\n    *   Sometimes cached builds can cause issues. Try clearing the Expo cache by running `expo start -c` or `expo cache:clear`.\n4.  **Reinstall Node Modules:**\n    *   Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file, then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.\n5.  **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:**\n    *   Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify potential version conflicts between your dependencies.\n6.  **Inspect the Code Around the Error:**\n    *   The error occurs in `LoanDetailScreen` at line 221. Examine the code in that area, specifically any components or libraries used there that might rely on native modules. The error occurs in this block:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  /* Payment History */\n}\n<View style={commonStyles.card}>\n  <Text style={styles.cardTitle}>Payment History</Text>\n  {payments.length === 0 ? (\n    <Text style={styles.emptyText}>No payments yet</Text>\n  ) : (\n    // ... rest of the code\n  )}\n</View>\n```\n\nIt's possible that the `commonStyles.card` is causing the issue. Try removing the style and see if that fixes the issue.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide the contents of your `package.json` file and your `metro.config.js` or `metro.config.ts` (if you have one) for further analysis.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-09T15:17:00.856011"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix this error.

Expo's `expo-sharing` is fully compatible with Expo Go and works across all platforms.\n\n2. **Updated the `handleSendReminder` function**: \n   - Now uses `expo-sharing` to share loan reminders\n   - Creates a temporary text file with the loan summary\n   - Shares it via the native share sheet\n   - Includes a fallback that shows an Alert if sharing isn't available (e.g., on web)\n\n3. **Installed required dependencies**:\n   - `expo-sharing`: For sharing functionality\n   - `expo-file-system`: For creating temporary files to share\n\nThe app should now work properly in Expo Go without the TurboModuleRegistry error. The \"Send Reminder\" button will open the native iOS share sheet where you can send the loan summary via WhatsApp, iMessage, SMS, or any other installed messaging app.\n\n**Note**: The sharing functionality works best on physical devices. In the iOS simulator or web, it will fall back to showing the message in an Alert dialog."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-09T15:16:46Z"}]
